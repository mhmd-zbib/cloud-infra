# cloud-infra

This repo is my lab for learning cloud and DevOps stuff. I'm using it to get hands on with:

- DevOps basics
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Kubernetes (k8s) for container orchestration
- Docker for building images
- Deploying services locally (not on AWS or GCP)
- Automating deployments with pipelines

Everything here is direct and practical. No fancy cloud setups just real tools, real configs, and real deployments on my own machine. 

## What you'll find
- Java microservices (alpha, beta)
- Dockerfiles for each service
- K8s manifests and kustomize structure
- GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, deploy
- Local deployment scripts and configs

## Why?
To get good at cloud, DevOps, and automation. That's it.
